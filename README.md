# DSPy Sentiment Analysis Workflow

This project demonstrates a step-by-step workflow for sentiment analysis using DSPy, showcased through an interactive web application.

## Project Overview

The DSPy Sentiment Analysis Workflow is a web-based visualization of the process of building a sentiment analysis model using DSPy. It provides an interactive flowchart that explains each step of the process, from setup to using the final predictor.

## Features

1. Interactive flowchart visualization
2. Detailed explanations for each step
3. Code snippets for implementation
4. Responsive design for various screen sizes

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript
- DSPy (Python library for the actual sentiment analysis implementation)

## Project Structure

The project consists of three main files:

1. `index.html`: The main HTML structure of the web application
2. `styles.css`: CSS styles for the layout and design
3. `script.js`: JavaScript for interactivity and dynamic content

### HTML Structure

The HTML file (`index.html`) sets up the basic structure of the page, including:

- A title and container for the flowchart
- Bubble elements for each step of the workflow
- A popup element for displaying detailed information

```html:index.html
startLine: 1
endLine: 40
```

### CSS Styling

The CSS file (`styles.css`) provides styles for:

- Overall layout and background
- Flowchart bubbles and connections
- Popup styles for detailed information
- Responsive design for various screen sizes

### JavaScript Interactivity

The JavaScript file (`script.js`) handles the interactivity of the flowchart, including:

- Animations for bubble hover and click effects
- Dynamic content loading for popup information
- Responsive layout adjustments for different screen sizes

## Usage

To run the project, open the `index.html` file in a web browser. The interactive flowchart will be displayed, allowing you to explore the steps involved in building a sentiment analysis model using DSPy.
